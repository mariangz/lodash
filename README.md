# Lodash

In this Codecademy's project, I've to implement some of the functionality from the widely-popular [lodash.js](https://lodash.com) library which provides many methods that add new functionality for numbers, strings, objects, and arrays.

## Implement

- [x] _.clamp()
- [x] _.inRange()
- [x] _.words()
- [x] _.pad()
- [x] _.has()
- [x] _.invert()
- [x] _.findKey()
- [ ] _.drop()
- [ ] _.dropWhile()
- [ ] _.chunk()
